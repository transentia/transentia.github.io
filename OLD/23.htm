          <p>Picked this up in December 1999 at the Linux/Open Source Bazaar, Jacob K. Javits Centre, New York.</p>

          <p>It has a tag on its 'behind' saying "Hi! I'm Tux The Linux Penguin" The badge has the heading "Penguin Power."</p>
          <p>The badge also uses the quaint spelling 'LinuX', which proves how old it is: who would spell it that way nowadays!</p>
          <p>I was presenting a 2-day tutorial session on Linux (RedHat 5.2). I have mentioned another trophy before.</p>

        <a id='4'></a><h1 class="entry-title">Java, Groovy, JavaFX</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>From late 1997 to late 2004, I developed and ran a very nice Java course. Took it all round the world, in fact.</p>
          <p>It's <strong>still available</strong>…and still <em>the best Java course</em> out there, IMHO (and I have given quite a few from several other [major] vendors in addition to my own).</p>
          <p>One of the exercises that that participants seemed to enjoy was to take an applet not to dissimilar from the Scribble applet published in David Flanagan's <em>Java in a Nutshell</em> and modify it so that the drawing persevered through
          screen redraws.</p>
          <p>This helped the participants get their head around anonymous inner classes and the applet lifecycle callbacks and also gave them a chance to play with the List collection interface/classes.</p>
          <p>Time moves on and we now have Groovy's <a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/Swing+Builder">SwingBuilder</a> and the new <a href="http://javafx.com/">JavaFX</a> technology promoted by Sun.</p>
          <p>Prompted by the negative press that JavaFX has received, postings such as <a href="http://lexecorp.com/2009/04/20/javafx-it-has-merit/">this</a> and the speed increases of the "consumer JRE", together with the fact that it is now
          bundled into <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Netbeans 6.5.1</a> (making it easy to get hold of and play with; not sure why it is currently missing in action for 6.7m3) I decided to see how the 'newcomers' stacked up.</p>
          <p>The examples aren't completely identical (one is an applet, while the others are JFrames, for example) but this is still a nice 'feel' exercise.</p>
          <p>I am reminded of the <a href="http://www.ariel.com.au/jokes/The_Evolution_of_a_Programmer.html">Evolution of a Programmer</a> joke…</p>
          <p>Here goes…</p>

        <a id='5'></a><h1 class="entry-title">The State Of The Groovy World</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>An overview, at least. By <a href="http://thirstyhead.com">Scott Davis</a>: <a href="http://groovy.markmail.org/message/7lsabbh2eldga4dm">http://groovy.markma … age/7lsabbh2eldga4dm</a>…</p>
          <p>I'll excerp the main bits:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Manning has Groovy in Action (and soon Grails in Action as well). Apress has quite a impressive cadre of titles, from DGG to Beginning Groovy and Grails, GORM, Grails + Flex, and more. The Prags have Venkat and I (Programming Groovy
            and Groovy Recipes, respectively), plus Dave Klein's upcoming Grails title. Morgan Kaufmann has the tragically underrated Groovy Programming.</p>
            <p>In terms of online articles, I've been writing <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=mastering+grails">Mastering Grails</a> for IBM developerWorks for a year and a half now.</p>
            <p>I've rebooted Andy Glover's old <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=practically+groovy">Practically Groovy series</a>. (BTW, I went back and rewrote every Groovy example dating back to 2004
            so that they run under modern Groovy - not as hard a task as you might imagine…) That's effectively 50-ish new pages of new material each month. (And boy are my arms tired… wink) Those articles are regularly among the most popular at IBM
            devWorks, FWIW. There's also the monthly GroovyMag, JavaWorld, <a href="http://groovy.dzone.com/">http://groovy.dzone.com/</a>, SCADS of personal blogs, the Groovy/Grails podcast from Glen and Sven, and more…</p>
            <p>I speak 30+ weekends a year on the NFJS tour talking about Groovy and Grails. That's in addition to JavaOne, TSSJS, QCON, JavaZone, and a host of others. When I'm not speaking publicly, I'm offering private Groovy/Grails
            training/mentoring/consulting through <a href="http://thirstyhead.com">http://thirstyhead.com</a> . There are many other folks, like Ken Kousen, smokejumper, SpringSource (natch), who do the same.</p>
            <p>Andy Glover's BDD framework <a href="http://easyb.org">easyb</a> - written in Groovy - just won a Jolt award. Both Groovy and Grails have won JAX awards. There's Griffon, Gant, Gradle, GMock and many other libraries/ frameworks that
            leverage the power of Groovy and Grails under the covers.</p>
            <p>Companies from Wired to LinkedIn to IBM to SAP to SkyTV to Tropicana to Pepsi to Mutual of Omaha to the (US) National Cancer Institute to many many others without a public-facing website or case study have adopted Groovy and
            Grails.</p>
            <p>The Groovy/Grails community has an embarrassment of riches to choose from. (Apologies if I missed an obvious addition to any of the informal lists I rattled off of the top of my head.) This mailing list alone should be an indication
            of how vibrant the community is.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>A nice <a href="http://groovy.markmail.org/message/2jay5rwuweukgdzb">follow-up quote</a> from Dierk König:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Unlike other languages, Groovy positions itself as "Java's dynamic friend" rather than trying to be a replacement.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>And <a href="http://groovy.markmail.org/message/ieq5wd45whrmazkp">a bit more</a> from Russel Winder:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Groovy, the symbiotic partner to Java on the JVM". The words "partner" and "symbiotic" are crucial here!</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>Where you need static type checking and fastest execution performance use Java, as soon as you need any form of reflection or dynamism consider switching that bit of your system to Groovy. <em>This is multi-language programming in a
            total system context</em>.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>(My italics)</p>
          <p>Time for <em>you</em>, dear reader, to jump on the Groovy bandwagon. Don't be afraid, the horses won't bite!</p>
