<h1>A Lensman Dies</h1>

<p>Xylpygic lay dying, entangled in the
twisted wreckage of his speedster. The red-hot glowing livid gash
slicing along the vessel&rsquo;s once proud hull bore violent
testimony to the titanically disruptive powers that had recently been
unleashed upon it. Xylpygic had triumphed of course. The pirate
vessel that had been his target was no more, reduced to its component
atoms streaming through interstellar space. The final energy blast
mustered by the desperate pirate ship during the last millisecond of
that pyrrhic battle had been too much for his shields however and now
Xylpygic&rsquo;s squid-like, multiply-tentacled, superbly streamlined
body lay immobile, life-giving fluids leaking away onto the rocky
landscape of this airless, nameless moon.</p>
<p>A thought rolled into Xylpygic&rsquo;s
pain-wracked, anguish-ridden mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray Lensman Xylpygic, you are
shortly to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the first touch of thought,
Xylpygic&rsquo;s pain vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mentor!&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Amazement flooded Xylpygic&rsquo;s
entire being, leading relief and sweet, sweet hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aside from trivial analgesia,
there is nothing I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fresh emotions drained away as
rapidly as they arrived, leaving behind only the bitterness of loss
and regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mentor&rsquo;s serene, sonorous
thought continued to roll through the Lensman&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You keenly feel the loss of
your kith and kin. You will miss the Patrol. These emotions are right
enough, for who knows what awaits in the next cycle of existence. You
feel regret at not seeing the job through &lsquo;to the end.&rsquo;
Your feelings are natural given your vitality, strength of mind and
will, but I am here to show you the fallacy of these feelings. Be at
rest knowing that your contribution was essential, invaluable. Your
life was Necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As your death is also
Necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less good to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am come in your final
millisecond to share with you my Visualisation of the Cosmic All,
that you may know the value of all you have done and all that you
achieve here today. Thus I work to facilitate your passage from this
cycle into the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There opened into Xylpygic&rsquo;s
mind the full, minutely-detailed Visualisation. He examined it, and
in so doing knew what the Arisians had done in seeding the known
universe with their spores, knew the genesis of the current struggle
with the Eddorians and what cost was being borne by the Arisians.
Xylpygic saw the role of the tool that was his beloved Galactic
Patrol and he finally perceived the fabulous galaxies-spanning
civilization that the Patrol was destined to bring into being.</p>

<p>As Xylpygic&mdash;under Mentor&rsquo;s
gentle guidance&mdash;examined the plan spread out in his mind, he
ran a full gamut of emotions: shock, awe, anger and fear, giving way
to final understanding of the full measure of his own contributions.
With that understanding came the realisation that his work WAS done
well, that he had nothing to regret, that his job truly had been done
&ldquo;to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mentor, for this
boon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with our gratitude,
Xylpygic, for your life and your life&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xylpygic&rsquo;s life came to its
end.</p>

<p>On far Arisia, the Attendant
Encilianas feels her connection to Xylpygic wrench away, observes the
Lensman&rsquo;s now dull, gray, also lifeless Lens start to
disintegrate and knows that the Lensman has died. 
</p>

<p>Although not yet a fully developed
adult, no mere watchman was Encilianas. As an Attendant, hers was a
specialist task: masquerading as Mentor to ease the passing of each
and every Lensman, wherever situate, and to witness the passage of
that Lensman&rsquo;s vital force from this plane of existence.</p>

<p>Encilianas directed a thought
towards the Elder Drounli who&mdash;as one of the four Arisian
Moulders of Civilisation&mdash;was known to Lensmen everywhere as the
Mentor of Arisia that trained them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father Drounli, I am truly
saddened by this event. The loss of Lensman Xylpygic seems to me to
be a setback greater than any other at this time. A mighty force he
was and surely could have joined the ranks of the Second Stage
Lensmen. This is a loss that will be keenly felt across the two
galaxies. My Visualisation does not make it clear to me as to why we
did not allow him to develop further and so use him to his fullest
abilities. I seek to understand better the reasoning behind this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drounli&rsquo;s calm, measured reply
came immediately and was replete with sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is
indeed a lamentable passing but a little thought should help you
better understand the importance of what we have to do. Consider:
although Chromium is a beautiful and shiny metal, it is fragile and
brittle. A skilled metallurgist knows that in small quantities it can
bring strength to an Iron alloy, but will be careful to not overuse
the element lest new weaknesses develop. The same is true of what we
do here: because they are few, our Second Stage Lensmen currently
operate unnoticed and thus to great effect. Although it is tempting
to do so, developing more of them would ultimately catastrophically
weaken the fledgling tool that is the Galactic Patrol and present
victory to the Eddorians. While Xylpygic was mighty in his own right,
the full strength of the Galactic Patrol is ultimately to be derived
from the composite whole.&rdquo; Drounli&rsquo;s thought became a
veritable embrace. &ldquo;Know that our Visualization will be true
and that Xylpygic and the many other Lensmen which whom you interact
will not have sacrificed in vain. Never despair, my daughter. You
perform a worthy task, one which is undeniably difficult given your
youth: while not a parent yourself, in loco parentis you give succour
and kindness to these, our manifold children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Better knowing her own essential
role in the scheme of things, Encilianas directed her attention to
the next broken, suffering, selfless and extraordinary Lensman.</p>
