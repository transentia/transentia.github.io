<h1>Cruel And Unusual Punishment</h1>

<p>&ldquo;I hereby find that your Graffiti has defaced our environment.&rdquo; intoned The Judge gravely, handing down his verdict. &ldquo;Your actions degrade the world for your fellow citizens and this will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graffiti is an age-old problem; one that up to now, has not had an appropriate punishment. That is to say, whatever punishment the court has been able to impose has been either ineffective or counter-productive. It is well known for example, that in many circles a conviction for Graffitiing is seen as a rite of passage conferring numerous perceived benefits on the offender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am normally required to hand down a community service order or fine or some sort of detention. However,&rdquo; The Judge paused for effect. &ldquo;The Prosecution has noted that you possess an active neural enhancement grid and have pointed out to me that this opens up a new sentencing pathway for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your &lsquo;artistry&rsquo;—as you would have it—clearly relies on a fine appreciation of colour, a keen set of senses and an ability to undertake delicate yet demanding activities. You plainly receive &lsquo;inspiration’ for your works from your appreciation of a wide variety of music, food and stimulants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken these factors into account in developing a sentencing scheme as follows: your neural enhancement grid will be adjusted such that you will see only highly muted colours; your perception of sound will be heavily filtered; your senses of touch, smell and taste will be greatly attenuated; your reaction speed will be decreased and your fine motor skills altered. In addition to this, your grid will be permanently patched to break the dopamine-based reward response for certain stimulants</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taken together, these changes should make it impossible for you to undertake any further &ldquo;works of art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In summary: three months’ worth of sensory deprivation should sort you out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</p>
