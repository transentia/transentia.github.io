<h1>Dental Floss</h1>

<p>It is bedtime in a sleepy house, in
a sleepy village on that planet where the many-toothed,
fiercely-fanged Vluurgian warriors of Vlaarch live.</p>

<p>Vloorm, for it is she, is telling a
bedtime story to the younglings arrayed around her. From his couch in
the corner, the famous Vlaarg indulgently listens in.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s listen in as well, shall
we:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is bedtime in a sleepy
house, in a sleepy village on that sleepy planet where the Humans
live.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The
sleepy Human was in the bathroom; she had just cleaned her teeth with
toothbrush and toothpaste and was brushing her long, fine hair when
suddenly her head was bitten clean off by a great big monster!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ever-so-brave,
ever-so-fierce monster&mdash;known as Uncle Vlaarg to friends and
family&mdash;paused before going on to bite another Human&rsquo;s
head off. He had a big problem: blood was dripping down his cheeks,
chunks of sleepy Human flesh were embedded in gaps between teeth and
he had lengths of sleepy Human hair wrapped around his big, fearsome
fangs. His rippers couldn&rsquo;t rip properly and his grinders
weren&rsquo;t grinding at all well. He just knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to do a good job on the next Human he came across unless
something was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Vlaarg picked at the hair
and pulled big, yukky chunks of flesh out from the gaps between his
teeth rows as well. He picked a piece of sleepy Human hair out of his
teeth using a tentacle at each end and made a back-and-forth sawing
motion. Human hair is great stuff, it helped clean out all the stuck
chunks of flesh! 
</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo;, he
said, &lsquo;My fangs feel cleaner than they have for years! I&rsquo;ve
even got rid of that smelly piece of Zorgian crest-bone that has been
stuck around my rear ripper for about a month!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of simply going off
to eat the next Human, clever uncle Vlaarg thought a bit: &lsquo;There
is good money to be made here.&rsquo;, he said. When he came home he
brought a couple of dozen human heads with him to sell to people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that, children, is the
story of how your uncle Vlaarg&rsquo;s first visit to the sleepy home
planet of the Humans taught him about cleaning and flossing teeth and
also made him the richest Vluurgian warrior on Vlaarch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vloorm twists a fond eyestalk
towards the oldest front-progeny, bends in low and whispers: &ldquo;It
is also the story of how your uncle Vlaarg revolutionised
front-mating: we girls just looove clean fangs and that fresh-human
meaty smell...oooh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pausing to wink 4 of her 12 eyes at
the hero of the story, Vloorm again directs her attention to the
batch of younglings before her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, off to the hatchery with
you! Be sure to brush properly, and don&rsquo;t forget to floss&mdash;your
uncle Vlaarg brought home a couple of nice fresh hairy human heads
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
