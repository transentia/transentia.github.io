<h1>Despair</h1>

<p><em>[Historical preface: This is the text of the message that the members of the First Thousand were greeted with when they awoke in orbit around </em>Nueva Vivienda<em>. The text does not accurately portray the depths of despair evidently felt by May Nelson. Listening to the actual audio of the message is a truly harrowing experience.]</em></p>

<p>I am first to wake from deepsleep; first ever to look down from orbit onto the surface of a new planet. Humanity&rsquo;s second home and potential salvation <em>Nueva Vivienda</em> floats over my head. My life&rsquo;s work is complete, my concepts vindicated, my labour successful.</p>

<p>I am filled with despair and hatred.</p>

<p>Mankind has attempted to head out to the stars before. In starships of ever-increasing size and complexity, we have sailed forth. A half-dozen ill-fated Titanics have launched; none reached their journey&rsquo;s end. Telemetry has taught us that the strange tides of the universe have created a more flotsam-strewn ocean than any we have heretofore sailed. The bigger the ship, the greater the likelihood of encountering some stray piece of cosmic debris, of being breached or beaching broken-backed on some hostile reef.</p>

<p>And so we changed tack; took a new approach. Fully a thousand of us set forth from Earth in our flotilla of tiny one-person pods. We swarmed into the universe, tenuously distributed across a volume of space a few cubic light-milliseconds in size and locked into a perennial, intricate dance around the larger but multiply-redundant and geometrically-dispersed beamed-power &lsquo;hubs.&rsquo; The swarm&mdash;so our thinking went&mdash;would be resilient in the face of any obstacle smaller than a planet and even then the light and nimble components should be able to manoeuvre out of danger.</p>

<p>Rejoice! Our thinking was evidently correct! The status board in front of me shows a bright sea of green and blue markers. Nine hundred and ninety-eight pods have survived. Nine hundred and ninety-eight colleagues and friends are slowly awakening.</p>

<p>The engineer in me joyfully labels those two lost pods a practically insignificant loss and rejoices that we have beaten the odds. Few of our simulations even hinted at the possibility of such success.</p>

<p>The rest of me, wife and mother to the occupants of those two failed pods, is overwhelmed. Shaken to my very soul. I have brought us all to a new world and given it a new future but triumph and joy are denied to me. I look up at the blue-green orb that was to be my future and now want no part of it.</p>

<p><em>Nueva Vivienda</em> is your future, not mine.</p>

<p>It has been trivial for me&mdash;one of the few &lsquo;superusers&rsquo; in the project&mdash;to alter the programming of my pod. I have given some thought to creating a fiery end for myself in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere or to diving into this system&rsquo;s sun but I refuse to bequeath a single one of my atoms to this hateful system. I am heading back along the path we have taken to get here, to lose myself as my husband and daughter have been lost. I dare to believe that our atoms will find each other within the interstellar wind and we will join in death as we once did in life.</p>

<p>May your hope remain alive within you all.</p>

<p>Off.</p>

<p><em>[Historical note 1: May Nelson&rsquo;s pod has never been found. The tragedy of this terrible event is of course that both Alan and Irene Nelson&rsquo;s pods were perfectly intact and the assumption is that May&rsquo;s pod was the only one to suffer a problem. As one of the foremost families within the First Thousand, the Nelson family is to this day a major force within </em>Nueva Vivienda<em>. Historical note 2: What compounds the tragedy is the modern awareness that extended deepsleep has a strong unbalancing effect on a person's emotions and decision-making faculties. Life on </em>Nueva Vivienda<em> would likely be greatly different if May Nelson had only waited for a short while. The chances are great that she would then have taken a less emotional, more rational path.]</em></p>
