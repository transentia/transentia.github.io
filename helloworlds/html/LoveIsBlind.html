<h1>Love Is Blind</h1>

<p>Hey Mum &amp; Dad!</p>

<p>Guess what: I&rsquo;ve met this great girl out here on Quaxxis
and we&rsquo;ve decided to get married!</p>

<p>We met a few months ago at one of the embassy&rsquo;s state
functions. </p>

<p>She&rsquo;s funny, clever, elegant and of high station. She&rsquo;s so
beautiful! She&rsquo;s tall and slim with green eyes and a lovely athletic figure. I absolutely
adore the way her copper pelt and blue snout complement each other.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s completely perfect and we love each other to bits!</p>

<p>Her Quaxxian name translates as: &ldquo;She of the high house of
Znarquis who basks openly on the shores of the deep red slime pools of Oorpt
while a myriad of suitors vie for her sexual favours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I call her &lsquo;Roxy.&rsquo; Seems appropriate, somehow.</p>

<p>I know what you are going to say&hellip;that whole &ldquo;men are from
Mars and women are from Venus&rdquo; spiel&hellip;that Human males and females have enough
trouble relating, let alone Human males and Quaxxian females. Trust me; I
definitely don&rsquo;t expect it all to be plain sailing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the issue of food, for one. You know how much I love
my hamburgers! Glarx-beetles—hunted down and eaten raw—are Roxy&rsquo;s staple.
Glarx-beetles are weird scorpion-lizard things about the size of a guinea-pig.
They are beautiful creatures but are also really scary: as vicious as hell and completely
deadly to humans. All the best houses have live glarx-beetle runs, so naturally
she is planning to have one when we set up our own clan-house. I&rsquo;ll have to
keep on my toes, I guess.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s traditional that newly-subjugated husbands are brought back to
the family clan-house for a period before the couple sets up their own. I
confess to being a little apprehensive about this but Roxy says that I&rsquo;ll fit
right in as a Beta-husband and she&rsquo;ll defend me if necessary&hellip;sounds a bit
ominous! She <em>swears</em> that she&rsquo;s not planning on getting an Alpha-husband.
</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s language. Being both a tonal and a chromic
language, Quaxxish is completely impossible for a human to master. The first
time I plucked up the courage to talk directly to Roxy&rsquo;s Alpha father, I
apparently told him to go mate with himself (I was only trying to wish him &ldquo;good
night&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s auto-translator for me all the way from now on :-). Even that&rsquo;s
not 100% perfect; a while back I did an auto-translator software update and we
nearly broke up as a consequence. Good job I decided to apply the bugfix when I
did&hellip;</p>

<p>As for the &ldquo;physical stuff&rdquo; (as my colleagues so delicately put
it)&hellip;well&hellip;we&rsquo;ve definitely got compatible &lsquo;equipment&rsquo; and remember: she&rsquo;s got
four arms. And a tail. &lsquo;nuff said?</p>

<p>Roxy is great with kids; boy, girl, queeg, quaag, zork: they
all adore her. We&rsquo;re planning to have one of each&hellip;5 children, phew!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s apparently an interesting wedding ceremony planned. I
obviously can&rsquo;t go through the full Quaxxian betrothal-battle and Roxy won&rsquo;t
tell me exactly what is ahead of me but she assures me that I will survive&hellip;most
likely. Gulp!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry that you can&rsquo;t come to the ceremony: you know
it takes 6 months to prepare the healthiest human for a visit to Quaxxis. Given
Dad&rsquo;s heart condition, I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;d even survive the acclimatization
process. I&rsquo;ll send you lots of pictures. Promise!</p>

<p>Hope you guys are happy for me. It'll be fun! Roxy and I are just <em>so</em> in love! What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Love you!</p>

<p>Ralph</p>
