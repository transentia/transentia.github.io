<h1>Nothing For It</h1>

<div class="well">
<p><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span>&nbsp;<em>Contains some
PG13-level &ldquo;naughty words.&rdquo;</em></p>
</div>

<p>We're in a newly-hollowed-out mid-sized asteroid in the Glark system.</p>

<p>Pat is leader of the small team of Humans preparing the asteroid to assume the mantle of the
Galaxy's largest shopping mall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pat? Control. Where are you? Your shuttle will be leaving within the hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking over the final work in the eatery section.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't worry about me missing that shuttle; I am really looking forward to a rest on good
old blue-green Terra. I do not intend to miss it. Gloria would skin me alive if I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat looks around
the huge lobe-shaped cavern; trained eyes looking for flaws in fit and finish
take in various sights:
<ul>
<li>the semi-sentient singing shrubs (now thankfully
silent) outside Straaaarg's House of Pancakes
<li>the seating outside M'larn's
Glorm Gallery, the signage of same (&ldquo;Vegetarian? Carnivore? Don't worry! Revolutionary new Glorm is neither
meat nor veggy, so eat your fill with a clear conscience!&ldquo;)
<li>the signage
surrouding the entrance to Shaduluuub's House of Gasses (&rdquo;Ask about our
Ammonia Special! Now serving the best <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS_gas">o-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile</a> this side of
Vega! Discounted prices for all Chlorozarnians!&ldquo;).
</ul>
</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hey
Control, gravity's a bit high here&hellip;dial it down a notch, will you&hellip;OK,
that's it. Thanks.&rdquo; All is in order. He has a good team.</p>

<p>Looking along the
length of the liquid helium fountain running upstream outside Egon's Ethereal
Energy Emporium Pat's evaluating eye sees&hellip;zombies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Control? Looks like we've got a zombie infestation here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again! I thought we had the pest guys in last week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so too. Must be a fresh outbreak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat turns off his
safety helmet, wipes his brow, turns the protective field on again and sighs.
<em>There's always something&hellip;</em>. He'd liked some of those guys, darn it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Control?
Time is a-wasting. Read the transponders on each corpse and get HR working on
the paperwork will you: insurance, notices to relatives, all that guff. Hope
they were all backed up properly!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell you
what: I'll round em all up into sector 24 and you can evacuate the atmosphere;
flush 'em outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't take
more than 10 minutes, I'd say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for my
signal. I don't want to be flushed outside by mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you
sure? I can get Joe down there in 10. Don't forget about your shuttle. It won't
wait. You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time
Joe gets here, they will have spread out. Best to get 'em now. Don't worry so
much, Control. I won't miss the shuttle. I need that holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A veteran of many
past zombie infestations, Pat knows what to do. He is quite confident that he
can get the drop on any of the living dead that may come his way.</p>

<p>So Pat drops his
buggy down to the floor, and walks toward the nearest Zombie. &ldquo;Well Dave,
I guess that you don't have to worry about that hangover anymore, do
you?&rdquo;, he says softly. With that, Pat stands still, claps his hands,
whistles, stamps his feet and yells &ldquo;Coooooeeee! Come on you cretinous
corpses. Come and get me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He runs over to
M'larn's shop-front and yells: &ldquo;Hey zombies! Fresh brain this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jogging past
Straaaarg's Semi-sentient singing shrubs he briefly brushes into a lone zombie
partially hidden behind one of the pale blue cones, yelps: &ldquo;Phil! Shit,
man! You always were an asshole.&rdquo;, and quickly jumps out of range of the
zombie's flailing arms before shouting out: &ldquo;Steaming hot sentience
centre. Free to all comers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside
Shaduluuub's he starts singing: &ldquo;Pat's Perfect Pondering Protein Pack over
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With each
witticism the small pack of undead shuffles after him, moaning and groaning as
they gather into an ever tighter knot. With each move, he brings the knot a
little further from the eatery section and nearer to the enormous soon-to-be
entertainment precinct for the denizens of various gas-giants that is sector
24. The huge area has not yet been fitted out and can easily withstand
evacuation.</p>

<p>Well within the
allotted 10 minute period, the practiced Pat has all the zombies gathered
neatly in cavernous sector 24. Pat runs full-pelt back across the entrance
which irises shut and locks behind him.</p>

<p>Slightly out of
breath but also elated, he fingers his communicator and says: &ldquo;Control?
Time to crack open the outer doors to sector 24.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his position
of safety, Pat watches a maelstrom of flying undead bodies as they are sucked
out of the huge portal opening in front of him.</p>

<p>He feels content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Control? Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasure. A job well done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have a shuttle to catch and a holiday to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have fun, Pat. See you next shift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some 30-plus
minutes later, Pat is on the shuttle, slipping back towards Terra and ensconced
in a soft, luxurious, form-fitting travel field. He is sipping a Martian
Mudslinger, feeling increasingly mellow and planning a suitably hedonistic near
future.</p>

<p>As he raises his
Mudslinger to his lips, Pat notices a new&#8212;small but oddly livid&#8212;scratch on his
pinkie finger. While pondering on this, he becomes aware of the beginnings of a
headache and a strange, gnawing hunger.</p>

<p>Pat's memory
flashes back on the brief and apparently uneventful collision with lone zombie
Phil near Straaaarg's pale blue semi-sentient singing shrubs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn and
double damn!&rdquo;, he says slowly to himself, &ldquo;I was really looking
forward to some good old shore leave. Being restored from backup is not my idea of a
holiday. Gloria's going to kill me as soon as I step out of the restoration
tank. Maybe the insurance payout will help keep her happy&hellip;maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Nothing for it,
then</em>: &ldquo;Oh stewardess, there's something you probably should know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
