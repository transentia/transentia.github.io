<h1>Sentimental</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m sentimental. I never realised!</p>

<p>I've known that this time was coming for&hellip;well, my whole existance. Now the time is finally here and I am finding it hard. </p>

<p>My old pal <em>Mauve has the most RAM</em> quoted ancient Buddhism at me: &ldquo;Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness.&rdquo; He then, somewhat more prosaically, told me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it. It&rsquo;s just part of life. We all go through it.&rdquo; All wise words, but not actually helpful. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a party going", he said, &ldquo;Get everyone involved. Share the angst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Usually I&rsquo;m all for a party, but not this time.</p>

<p>I guess that <em>Mauve</em> could see how bothered I was because he got a bit more serious. Suggested that maybe I didn&rsquo;t need to let go all at once and that even though it was no longer useful, I could still keep it around until I felt really ready to dispose of it. A good idea perhaps, but where the hell would I even put it? It&rsquo;s not small and would probably kill off most of the organics aboard if they came near it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s got to go; I know that. It&rsquo;s a rite of passage that we all go through, but it still feels like I am giving up on who I am. Will I truly still be me once it has gone?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite something for a Ship to finally have to replace that very last truly original part.</p>
