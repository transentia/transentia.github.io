<h1>Services Rendered</h1>

<p>The professor sat in his chair,
still and silent with his metallic golden eyes unseeing as his
expanded consciousness sifted, processed, categorised and theorised.
Around him, the conversation ebbed and flowed.</p>

<p>Unnoticed by all, he finally
stirred.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlebeings, I believe I have
the answer to the question of the moment, this being: what has
happened to the Portals?&quot; 
</p>

<p>Although soft, his voice immediately
cut through the chatter and the room faded into expectant silence. 
</p>

<p>&quot;It is my conclusion that the
message now being shown upon all Portal consoles in place of the
customary operating interface is a demand for payment for services
rendered. We have based our civilisation on the Portal System and now
the owners are demanding recompense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leader of the group of beings
gathered in attendance started in on the customary appreciations and
congratulations, but was cut off practically instantaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more.&quot;</p>

<p>Those members of the group skilled
in reading human body language were suddenly able to note a distinct
touch of fear in the man's demeanour as he continued.</p>

<p>&quot;As you know, we did not build
the Portal System. No known race did. They may be billions of years
old.</p>

<p>&quot;It is an enduring mystery why
no Portal-using star-spanning civilization has apparently been able
to survive as such for longer than approximately one hundred thousand
years. The fossil records are quite clear: any civilisations reaching
that age seem to dissipate overnight, archaeologically speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;It is natural
to expect a wide variation in the lifespans of the civilisations,
with the primary factor probably being the aggressiveness of the
dominant species involved. This does not seem to be reflected in
reality: we have recorded the existence of several shorter-lived or
less widespread groupings, but nothing in the fossil record on any of
the planets on which we reside admits to the possibility of any older
society.</p>

<p>&quot;Our oldest records&mdash;requiring
deep searching and extensive reformatting to access along with
subsequent subtle translating&mdash;indicate to me that we first
accessed the Portal System approximately one hundred thousand years
ago. We have always expected to use them for much longer, even given
humanity's predilection for violence and self-destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>The professor closed his golden eyes
and took in a long, deep breath. When he continued, he seemed to be
forcing the words out, as though fighting a real and visceral pain.</p>

<p>&quot;We know that the Portal
builders are clearly an advanced and powerful people. Since we cannot
build a Portal&mdash;or even accurately determine the actual age of
one, please note&mdash;we must assume that they are much more
advanced than we ourselves.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot, as yet, determine what
would constitute appropriate payment for such an advanced race. I attach
a very high probability that no member of this civilisation will
ever be able to determine this.&quot;</p>

<p>The professor waited until calm had
reasserted itself before continuing.</p>

<p>&quot;This brings us to the real
question, the one you did not know you were asking.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlebeings, the real question is
this: what of the &lsquo;debt collector&rsquo;?&quot;</p>
