          <p>Yes, I know that one is <em>supposed</em> to start out on Agile using only its 'purest' form, and adapt it only after experience tells you which way to jump, but this has got to be A Good Thing (hasn't it?!)</p>

          <p>Following on from <a href="wordpress/2009/04/16/how-to-find-unused-jars/">How To Find Unused Jars?</a>…</p>
          <p>There is the strangely-named <a href="http://www.jorion.org/jbalboa/jbalboa.html">JBalboa</a>.</p>
          <p>It is a separate static-analysis tool that can discover which jars in a given directory are never used and find which Jar(s) a class can be found in.</p>
          <p>There is a GUI:</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/04/jbalboa.jpg"></p>
          <p>And there's a command-line mode, as well.</p>
          <p>There's also JBoss' <a href="http://www.jboss.org/tattletale.html">Tattletale</a>: "Betraying your project's naughty little secrets."</p>
          <p>Runs on the command line or via an ant task.</p>
          <p>Useful stuff!</p>

          <p>I <a href="http://www.overclockers.com.au/image.php?pic=images/newspics/17apr9/4.jpg">came across</a> <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Web_Development/Miscellaneous/Q_22031739.html">this</a> today:</p>

          <p>Apparently, this <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Coded_Smorgasbord_0x3a__Prepare_For_Return.aspx">became</a> a daily WTF.</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">Three Interesting Reads</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>Following on from Best Book I've Read In A Long Time…</p>
          <p>I'm working my way (dipping into each as the mood takes me, so in no particular order) through these guys:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961">Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum</a><br>
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321534468/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams</a><br>
          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Robert-Martin/dp/0131479415/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239960205&amp;sr=1-1">Agile Estimating and Planning</a></p>
          <p>The thing that all these have in common is that they give you the feeling that the authors have "been there, man."</p>
          <p>They also have a feeling of optimism: "the solution is in here, just look harder."</p>
          <p>I like this feeling!</p>
          <p>I have to disable my <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Emotion_chip">cynicism chip</a>, but that's probably all to the good ;-)</p>
          <p>On the bad side, they make me feel like I have wasted a career :-(</p>
          <p>It's not that I want to be a Project Manager, heavens no!</p>
          <p>it's just that I want to work with a project management team that has <em>read and understood</em> the messages here. &lt;sigh emphasis='heavy' /&gt;</p>
          <p>Like <em>that's</em> going to happen anytime soon!</p>
          <p>Here in Brisbane (Queensland, Australia; not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane,_California">the one in California</a>), <a href="http://www.prince2.com/">Prince2</a> is going great guns in Government circles (which is
          practially all that there is around here…). As I said before: there seems to be a 'spirit of <em>"hey it's not working, let's throw more</em> X <em>at it"</em>'</p>

          <p>I just received an email from one of the 2008 <a href="http://nzoug.org/">NZOUG</a> conference organisers, saying in part:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>…more than 80% of the people attending your presentation at the 2008 NZOUG conference said it was either 'Very Good' or 'Excellent' :-)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Nice to know that the presentations were well regarded!</p>

          <p>This is something that should be brainlessly easy, IMHO.</p>
          <p>Anybody on the JVM team listening out there?</p>
          <p>Until this becomes a standard feature of the JVM, we have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/loosejar/">LooseJar</a>.</p>
          <p>It's been around for a while, but I haven't got round to writing about it…until now.</p>
          <p>I can't say it any better than the original:</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/04/loosejar-blurb.png"></p>
          <p>It works as advertised. Always a good thing!</p>
          <p>Here's a quick example of what the JMX bean interface gives you:</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">Professionalism In Our Industry?</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>I'm an IT contractor. I go for lots of interviews. I get asked lots of questions…some strange, some difficult, some easy. Some <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/all/">piss me off</a>!</p>
          <p>Probably the question that gets up my nose more than any other goes like this: "You do a lot of presentations and article writing! You're just an academic in disguise." The supposition being, of course, that the world would collapse if
          I were to be let loose on their systems.</p>
          <p>On hearing this, I generally take a deep breath and tell myself that hitting the questioner would not be conducive to landing the gig, and then I go on to try to disabuse the poor benighted soul of his/her misconception. I often use
          calm, reasoned responses like: "Why did you bother bringing me here? Just to insult me? What have I done to you?"</p>
          <p>(I often tell myself that when I was teaching C programming at University, the interviewer was probably just learning to SPELL 'Sea' :-))</p>
          <p>Every time I come out of such an interview, I feel sad.</p>
          <p>Not just because I can see another gig opportunity going down the gurgler…it's their loss, after all!</p>
          <p>No…I feel sad for our industry as a whole.</p>
          <p>Lawyers, doctors, dentists, pharamacists and 'real' engineers are <em>all</em> <strong>required</strong> to undertake Continuous Education throughout their working life. For lawyers and doctors especially there is an expectation that
          they will contribute to learned journals and conferences. It is a mark of their professional standing to "do a lot of presentations and article writing."</p>
          <p>In many cases, if they don't undertake <em>audited</em> amounts of CE every year, they get kicked out.</p>
          <p>In the ICT world, one has to beg, scream and cry tears of blood to even get <em>considered</em> for training. Many people <em>take personal time off from their jobs</em> to go to conferences and courses. How sick is that!</p>
          <p>Organisations like the <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/">ACS</a> continually bemoan the <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,21449857-15317,00.html">lack</a> of <a href=
          "http://www.acs.org.au/news/111006.htm">Professionalism</a> in our industry. Well, here is something that needs to be dealt with. Urgently.</p>
          <p>By the way: I have decided to create a new category for this sort of posting. I hope you enjoyed the first 'official' Rant!</p>
