        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>…brevity, perhaps?</p>
          <p>Too often, I see code like:</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/groovy-no-with.jpg"></p>
          <p>Groovy lets us create much neater code:</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/groovy-with.jpg"></p>
          <p>I find the version with 'with' much clearer. It isn't actually shorter but-much more importantly-the code clearly indicates: "Dear MAINTAINER: this is doing a bunch of things that are related or require a shared context; break this
          apart at YOUR PERIL."</p>
          <p>It's <a href="http://java.dzone.com/news/getting-groovy-with-with">not perfect</a>, but it is better than nothing and it'll do for now…</p>
          <p>I put this out there in the hope that a few will discover this 'new' statement (the 'with' statement is present in algol68, and may even be older), and a few others will recall it…my contribution to a better world ;-)</p>

          <p>Drectly quoting: <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/agile-usability/message/5513">Re: When does Agile fail?</a></p>
          <p>The answer would have to look like:</p>
          <p>- When does it work better to focus on process and tools, because focusing on individuals and interactions would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on comprehensive documentation, because focusing on working software would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on contract negotiation, because focusing on customer collaboration would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on following a plan, because focusing on responding to change would fail?</p>
          <p>Pretty much everything else comes down to, "we tried some set of techniques and strategies, and operationally, they didn't work for us."</p>
          <p>Which doesn't say anything about whether "agile" works or not, more about how well the organization reacted, how appropriate the<br>
          strategies chosen, and how the people worked together.</p>
          <p>By the way, if you think this is an unfair test, try reversing it:</p>
          <p>- When does it work better to focus on individuals and interactions, because focusing on process and tools would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on working software, because focusing on comprehensive documentation would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on customer collaboration, because focusing on contract negotiation would fail?<br>
          - When does it work better to focus on responding to change, because focusing on following a plan would fail?</p>
          <p>I think we can construct answers to those.</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">Waste Not, Want Not?</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>I like <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122721278056345271.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">this quote</a> from Rahm Emanuel, US President Barack Obama's chief of staff:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Things that we had postponed for too long, that were long-term, are now immediate and must be dealt with. This crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do
            before."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This was given as the opening line of a <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com.au/">ThoughtWorks</a>-sponsored breakfast briefing that I attended this morning. The topic was "Lean times require Lean Thinking" and was promoted thusly:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Toyota Way, also known as Lean, was born from hardship and survival. It is an approach that does not rely on the accidental fortunate circumstance of being in a positive business climate. The system that propelled Toyota to the
            top of the global automotive industry is designed to succeed in both good times and bad.</p>
            <p>Lean thinking fundamentally changes the engagement model between IT and the business, challenging traditional relationships with staff, customers and partners.</p>
            <p>This session, presented by a partnership between ThoughtWorks and KM&amp;T, explains the Lean approach to challenges, continuous improvement, productivity, and quality, and how these principles can help you deliver high-value,
            high-quality software solutions to reduce operational costs, increase pro?tability, and survive.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>As the purse-strings tighten, maybe we can learn from Toyota's experience: stop doing BDUF/waterfall projects, move our organisations from their currrent "Authority Focus" to a new "Responsibilty Focus", start taking the Agile Manifesto
          to heart, start learning to actually <em>use</em> our technologies rather than fear them (newsflash: periodically snapshotting a database for 'offline' use is <em>not</em> inherently a safer solution to 'live dipping', even if it feels
          more comfortable; newsflash: the days when RAM/disk was more expensive than programmer time is <em>long gone</em>; newsflash: FTP is not the perfect SOA transport; newflash:a project's success is <em>not</em> to be measured by the number
          of shelf-feet of documentation it produces; I could go on…and on…and on…)</p>
          <p>I was particularly interested in the way that Toyota's use of Lean helped get the Prius to market faster, at significantly lower cost and with far fewer team members than any other company could have managed.</p>
          <p>Maybe interest in the agile methodologies is beginning to have an effect: perhaps Scrum, XP and Lean are about to go mainstream? There is certainly a lot more 'buzz' around now…</p>
          <p>I can but dream!</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">Best Book I've Read In A Long Time</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p><em>(Best technical book, anyway…)</em></p>
          <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675">The Art of Agile Development</a> by <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/">James Shore</a> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3187">Shane
          Warden</a>.</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/art-agile-dev.jpg"></p>
          <p>Excellent content presented very clearly. <em>This</em> is the book to show a worried team or sceptical manager.</p>
          <p>Hmmm…it's actually a bit thick for your average <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PHB">PHB</a>. Not too many pictures either, come to think of it :-)</p>
          <p>One of my colleagues <a href="http://lexecorp.com/2009/03/16/program-management/">recently asked</a> for the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
          Maintenance</a>' for the Project and Program Management space.</p>
          <p>This is it, IMHO.</p>
          <p>In the words of one reviewer on Amazon:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Finally somebody put together a book with the sharpest insights that you find…</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Another reviewer finished up with:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Buy the book, read it, use it to implement agile practices and return to it frequently.</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">Map Your Mind</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>"Real Programmers do UML."</p>
          <p>One hears that a lot, but to be honest I have had better experiences with <em>much</em> simpler tools: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note">sticky notes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC_cards">CRC
          cards</a>. These are simple, easy to work with and you don't need to fight an application's feature set and associated 'foibles' when all you want to do is organise and formalise your thoughts.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I often turn to <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a> when I am trying to 'brainstorm' a presentation or a document or a design/architecture, or…pretty much anything,
          really.</p>
          <p>You don't need gobs of training to use it, it is quick, easy and the end result is immediately clear.</p>
          <p>The following diagram shows the early stages of a map about my cat, Furball:</p>
          <p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mindmap-furball.jpeg"></p>
          <p>You should be able to get a good 'feel' for what is going on here almost immediately (I challenge anyone to say that about an equivalent UML diagram…if such were to exist).</p>
          <p>You can't see it here but one of the major ways in which FreeMind wins is ease of maipulation. It is just so easy to move branches around, reorder things, insert/delete nodes, link related ideas together, categorise concepts, etc.. A
          few mouse-clicks or drags is usually all it takes. It is not unusual for me to reorganise a given map many times before I get it to "feel right." This freedom to "change the world around" isn't usually available (or not to the same degree)
          in the more heavyweight tools/techniques.</p>
          <p>FreeMind is a great example of free software.</p>
          <p>Every team to which I have introduced FreeMind has adopted it with gusto, and I know that it has become a standard tool in the arsenal of many past colleagues.</p>
          <p>Add it into your toolkit <em>now</em>.</p>
          <p><em>[edit]</em><br>
          My good friend <a href="http://www.asert.com.au/index.htm">Dr. Paul King</a> reminded me that Freemind 0.9+ is Groovy-enabled. This is A Good Thing.</p>
