        <h1 class="entry-title">Is Going for the Low-Hanging Fruit Good Enough?</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>Why?…that's the feeling I have after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Java-Developers-Stuart-Halloway/dp/097761669X">Rails for Java Developers</a>.</p>
          <p>The book (given 4 1/2 stars by its reader-reviewers) is fine and nicely illustrates the Java way vs. the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> way, but as to the Rails way itself…hmmm.</p>
          <p>Typically the authors introduce a problen with a Java example, followed by an equivalent piece of Rails code and announce "Look, ma: no XML!" or "That was much less to type, wasn't it children…." Time and again however, the discussion
          moves onto a disclaimer:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The place where Rail's default logging falls far short of log4j is in supporting a variety of appenders</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>If you need these [client-side validation with Javascript/internationalization] features in your Rails application, you will have to find a plugin or roll your own.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Ruby world does not have anything as comprehensive as CruiseControl.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Ruby IDEs do not offer nearly the level of code completion and refactoring that the best Java IDEs do.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Because the Java platform includes a virtual machine specification with documented profiling hooks, it beats Ruby profiling not only in practise but in concept</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>ActiveRecord provides no support for distributed transactions, and when we miss them, we miss them acutely. <em>Rails is currently unsuitable for systems that must enforce transactional semantics across different databases.</em> But
            chin up! The JRuby team ( <a href="http://www.jruby.org">http://www.jruby.org</a>) is working to make JRuby on Rails viable. Once it is, we will have access to Java's transaction APIs.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>There seems to be a pattern here…</p>
          <p><em>[edit: I guess I didn't make myself clear here. I was struck by the fact that there always seems to be a disclaimer. Open any page, follow the topic and before the coverage is complete you will see this sort of disclaimer…. So:</em>
          why?<em>]</em></p>
          <p>My impression is that Ruby is really going after the low-hanging fruit, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outing">not that there is anything wrong with that</a>.</p>
          <p>As far as I can see, however, the bushes (at both the low-hanging and tip of the tree levels) are pretty well picked over by the myriad of PHP, Perl, Python and Java frameworks out there (and let's not forget <a href=
          "http://www.grails.org">Grails</a>), and I find myself wondering whether Ruby/Rails really has the 'puff' to go to the next level. Leaving aside the existence of JRuby for the moment, this pretty much means reimplementing the whole IT
          infrastructure: transaction management, messaging, view/templating/conversation technologies, testing, etc., etc.. <em>Everything</em>.</p>
          <p>Yes, redoing everything for Ruby/Rails probably is fun (especially if you missed or have a hankering to re-live the dot-com bubble era…) and may even reduce the amount of keyboard pounding that Joe Rails Programmer has to do, but is
          this effort really valuable?</p>
          <p>Perhaps I am too old to really appreciate the subtleties here. After all, as the old adage goes: <em>if you can't change the people,</em> change <em>the people</em>.</p>

          <em>I always find it strange (and a little concerning) that after 20+ years in the IT business I still go to interviews and am asked questions like "So. Are you a Stateless Session Bean expert?" or "We have SuperWidgetServer version 7.32…I
          see that you are familiar with 7.31. Will that be a problem for you?"…I also find it strange when I interview people who proudly announce their expertise along similar lines.</em></p>
          <p>I am forcibly reminded of a quote from a character created by the late, great Science Fiction author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act
            alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.</p>
            <p>Specialization is for insects.<br>
            -Lazarus Long, Time Enough For Love</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>That man was a genius…but he didn't live to see our crazy future; he did, however <a href="http://boards.history.com/topic/How-Should-Television/These-Are-Heinleins/100005690">predict it</a>.<br>
          &lt;/aside&gt;</p>
          <p>Now, while I am at it, a variety of shameless plugs cannot hurt…</p>

            "the search for meaning" and "the importance of brand me") are being ditched in favour of more brutal command-and-control methods.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>Just came across this welcome addition to the Java ecosystem: <a href="http://perf4j.codehaus.org/index.html">Perf4J</a>.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>…a set of utilities for calculating and displaying perfomance statistics for Java code.</p>

          <p>Even the byline is interesting: <em>Perf4J is to System.currentTimeMillis() as log4j is to System.out.println()</em>.</p>
          <p>Perf4J supplies useful tidbits like GraphingStatisticsAppender and JmxAttributeStatisticsAppender. It seems like performance monitoring has never been easier…</p>
          <p>Anyone familiar with the near-ubiquitous Log4J shoould have no trouble wrapping their head around Perf4J.</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title">An Interesting Survey</h1>
        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>Just posted on <a href="http://www.scrummaster.com.au/Article.mvc/Detail/43">Scrummaster.com.au</a>.</p>
          <p>Some interesting results:<br>
          Question: "Who is the main driver for quality in your organisation?" Answer: ~50% said "the team."<br>
          <em>It seems in general as though even an organisation's [ahem] "Test Manager" isn't paid enough to care…</em><br>
          Question: "Is your Product Owner a Business Analyst" Answer: ~80% said 'No or No Product Owner."<br>
          <em>Maybe no one is paid to care…?</em></p>
          <p>Call me an impetuous Sun of a Gun if you must, but these results don't reflect well on IT management, IMHO.</p>
          <p>Still, the glass is actually half-full: even while behemoths like <a href="http://www.prince2.com/">Prince2</a> are growing in popularity (reflecting the spirit of <em>"hey it's not working, let's throw more</em> X <em>at it"</em>?), at
          least there exist organisations <em>trying</em> to do Scrum.</p>
