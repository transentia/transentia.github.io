<h1>Review of Recent Activities</h1>
  <p>Thursday, 18 January 2001</p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This document provides a brief outline of the activities of Transentia Pty. 
    Ltd. at the conclusion of its first year of activities.</p>
  <h2>Achievements in 2000</h2>
  <p>2000 was a busy year!</p>
  <p>Major activities included the presentation of various training sessions to 
    over 60 participants together with various consulting projects undertaken, 
    and the development and 'live' installation of the <i>Simple2Link</i> Java-based 
    distributed system. </p>
  <h3>Alliances</h3>
  <p>Two key alliances were forged between the Brisbane-based firms <i>ASERT Consulting</i> 
    and <i>eTwo</i>. </p>
  <p>These will provide access to new areas of speciality, increase the utilisation 
    of Transentia's courseware assets, increase Transentia's client base and will 
    make it possible for all allies to come together to participate in larger-scale 
    projects than they would be able to handle individually.</p>
  <h3>Consulting</h3>
  <p>2000 saw Transentia develop a wide customer base and completing 
    consulting activities for a number of organisations including both 
    large and small enterprises and with both a national and international flavour.</p>

    reporting through firewall installation to project progress evaluations.</p>

    the Enterprise by Example</i> in Austin, Texas in April further helped Transentia 
    gain credibility as a developer and consultant in middleware and related fields.</p>
