<p>The following text is taken verbatim from a recent testimonial, with identifying features 
  removed:</p>
<div style="font-style:italic;margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;">
      <p>"[CLIENT] engaged Mr Brown to provide training and consultancy to IT 
        staff in Java 2 Enterprise. This involved concepts and use of tools (JBuilder6). 
        A one week consultancy was completed with the intention that further consultancies 
        regarding application design will be undertaken once staff have mastered 
        the basic technology.</p>

      <p>Mr Brown is very knowledgeable in his subject area and training was easy 
        to follow and understand. A number of staff had little direct experience 
        with the technology and tools but were able to complete the exercises 
        and get a working product. The week was not without a number of technological 
        problems which from a training perspective held up progress but from an 
        ongoing development perspective was very good as it provided all staff 
        with insights about issues likely to be confronted in the future. Mr Brown 
        was able to work through the issues, some of which he had not seen before, 
        and provide explanations and/or solutions. Mr Brown was able to achieve 
        this in spite of being requested not to do any preparation prior to the 
        consultancy.</p>

      <p>Mr Brown has a very clear and concise training style, is able to adapt 
        to the directions set by the group, and is able to understand specific 
        issues raised and provide advice which directly relates to the issue at 
        hand.</p>

      <p>Mr Brown is very easy to work with, flexible, practical, and has a balanced 
        view of competing technology architectures.&quot;</p>
